Lab Exercise 2 - Shell Control Structure

Program Description

Your task is to create an interactive BASH script that would ask the user to input a counting number n. 
If n is greater than 0, your script must compute the sum and the product of even counting numbers up to 
n and display them. Otherwise your program must display a goodbye message and halt.

Hint: To halt use the function exit.

Your script must also fetch one command line argument. This parameter is the name that would be 
displayed on the welcome greetings when the script runs (see sample run). If the user did not provide 
any argument or has provided more than one argument your program must output the following:

Usage: <name_of_script> name
This script requires one argument.

Sample Run 1:

$ ./E2_Garay.sh Raph
Welcome, Raph!
Enter a counting number: 4
The sum of even counting numbers up to 4 is 6.
The product of even counting numbers up to 4 is 8.
Enter a counting number: 9
The sum of even counting numbers up to 9 is 20.
The product of even counting numbers up to 9 is 384.
Enter a counting number: -1
Oops! -1 is not a counting number. Adios!

Sample Run 2:

$ ./E2_Garay.sh
Usage: ./E2_Garay.sh name
This script requires one argument.
